                        I am a junior web developer with enthusiasm for creating through code. I fell in love with web design when I created my first website on google in primary school.
                        I stumbled around for a while, figuring out the world of coding but once I rediscovered wed-development I remembered why I was drawn to coding in the first place.
                        I learned a lot on my journey and have gained a range of experience that I can pull from. I firmly believe that understanding the bigger picture is helpful when
                        working on specific tasks.

                        Most relevant experience:<br>
                        <br>
                        Working with mine and other dogs has taught me the most about how we all think, feel and learn. I gained patience an understanding for other perspectives.<br>
                        <br>
                        I learned time management, sticking to budgets, people management and conflict resolution between staff and gained a lot of business insight when working
                        for a high-net-worth individual in London.<br>
                        <br>
                        In my marketing work I learned a lot about different marketing techniques and I gained a basic understanding of how digital marketing works and what to look out for.
                        Most importantly, I expanded on my skills of understanding others and have developed a habit of putting the user first.<br>
                        <br>
                        My skillset may be unique, but it's also unique.
